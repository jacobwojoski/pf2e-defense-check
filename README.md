# pf2e-defense-check
## Overview
Stop rolling attacks as a gm. Turn your monsters attack into a DC.
let the player roll their AC to see if they properly deffend from the attack.

New TTRPG players can feel useless when the monster is running over and swings at them. 
- "What do you mean I cant move out of the way?"
- "I would try to dodge that for sure!"
- "I Just stand here?"

Or better yet you can keep them engadged when its not their turn. They
will be way more incline to pay attention when they need to roll to see 
if the BBEG hit them.
